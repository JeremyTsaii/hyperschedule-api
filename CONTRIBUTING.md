## Code style

For Python code, please adhere to the following conventions:

* Imports should be alphabetized. Avoid using `from` imports.
* Use `snake_case` for variables and functions, `CamelCase` for
  classes, and `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
* Don't use type annotations.
* Use double quotes for strings.
* Don't use backslashes for line continuation; prefer parentheses.
* Don't use `%` formatting for strings.

Above all, try to make new code compatible in style with existing
code. If you would like to propose a change to the style guidelines,
then don't hesitate. What we would like to avoid is extra work in
making different parts of the code consistent.
